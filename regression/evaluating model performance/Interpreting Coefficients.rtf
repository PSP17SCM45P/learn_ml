\f0\fs24 \cf0 Interpreting Linear Regression Coefficients\
\
As we can see from the sm.OLS().summary(), there are indications of the coefficients at each run of the algorithm. What we end up finding is that the coefficients only can be compared to each other if they are within the same unit, otherwise you can say that the coefficients are significant per their unit mapped to what they are predicting.\
\
Example:\
\
7.966e-01 is the estimate coefficient for R&D spending. We are predicting profit. That means that are for every 1 unit (read: $1) increase in R&D spent, we gain a $0.79 profit.\
