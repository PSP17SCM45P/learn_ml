\f0\fs24 \cf0 Linear Regression\
- Pros: Size agnostic\
- Cons: 5 Linear Assumptions\
\
Polynomial Regression\
- Pros: Works well with non-linear datasets, must understand order of polynomial\
- Cons: Bias/Variance tradeoff relies on the polynomial order\
\
SVR\
- Pros: Works well with non-linear problems, not biased by outliers\
- Cons: More difficult to understand and therefore customize\
\
Decision Tree Regression\
- Pros: Doesn\'92t require feature scaling, works well with both linear and non-linear problems\
- Cons: Easily overfits, bad with smaller datasets\
\
Random Forest Regression\
- Pros: Works well with linear and non-linear\
- Cons: Good knowledge on how many classifiers to select, easily overfits, no interpretability}
