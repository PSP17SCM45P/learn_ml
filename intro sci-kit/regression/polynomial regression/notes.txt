Polynomial Regression, also known as "Polynomial Linear Regression"

Example given: single feature, using different powers of it.

We have a human aspect when using polynomial regression. We need to look at what
the training set looks like it would fit. If it looks like the best fit would
be a polynomial function, then indeed that is what we will pick.

      X              Y
------------     ---------
    1               110
    2               130
    3               160
    4               200
    
This training data implies a non-linear function that would fit it best. This
is a case where we would use polynomial regression.

y = θ0 + θ1*X1 <--- Linear

However, we can use our features to our own advantage. We can quite literally
make our features of the ones we already have.

      X         X1^2         Y
------------  -------    ---------
    1           1            110
    2           4            130
    3           9            160
    4          16            200
    

y = θ0 + θ1*X1 + θ2*(X1)^2

Using the machinery of linear regression, we are now able to introduce
polynomial regression.
